# circles.lol



### Todo

- [ ] add palette tool
- [ ] experiment with generating circles in [-1,1] or [0,1] coords, to make it easier to rescale (will need to save aspect ratio)
- [ ] fit loaded image into screen size
- [ ] add fullscreen button
- [ ] add save function  
- [ ] add generate png function  
- [ ] add generate svg function
- [ ] add grid optimization to circle packing worker  
- [ ] better multitouch on mobile

### Ideas

- [ ] Gallery
- [ ] Wireframe editor
- [ ] Swipe between palettes on mobile. Could probably interpolate between them as a transition effect too
- [ ] Could make it tile by using mod, then allow panning

### In Progress
